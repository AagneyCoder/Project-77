        An integrated development environment (IDE) is a feature-rich program that supports many aspects of software

        and then publish an app.

        In computer technology, a console can mean different things depending on the context. It usually means a
        combination of a display monitor and an input device, usually a keyboard and mouse pair, which allows a user to
        input commands and receive visual output from a computer or computer system.
